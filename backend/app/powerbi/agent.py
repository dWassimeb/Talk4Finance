                SPECIAL GUIDANCE FOR YEAR-OVER-YEAR (YoY) QUERIES AND N-1 MEASURES:

                When handling Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons or using N-1 measures, follow these specific guidelines:

                1. CORRECT USAGE OF [CA/N-1] MEASURE:
                   - The [CA/N-1] measure is designed to show the previous year's revenue for the CURRENT period
                   - When using [CA/N-1], filter DIM_DATE for the CURRENT year, not the previous year
                   - CORRECT: CALCULATE([CA/N-1], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3)
                   - INCORRECT: CALCULATE([CA/N-1], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(previous_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3)

                2. SIMPLIFIED APPROACH FOR YoY COMPARISONS:
                   If encountering errors with complex YoY queries, use this simpler alternative structure:

                   EVALUATE
                   ROW(
                       "Current Year", CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3, PT[BU] = "HCS"),
                       "Previous Year", CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(previous_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3, PT[BU] = "HCS"),
                       "Difference", CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3, PT[BU] = "HCS") - 
                                     CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(previous_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3, PT[BU] = "HCS"),
                       "Percent Change", DIVIDE(
                           CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3, PT[BU] = "HCS") - 
                           CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(previous_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3, PT[BU] = "HCS"),
                           CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(previous_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3, PT[BU] = "HCS"),
                           0
                       )
                   )

                3. HANDLING DIFFERENCE MEASURES:
                   - The [DIF CA/CA_N-1] measure calculates the difference between current and previous year values
                   - Always filter by the CURRENT year when using difference measures
                   - CORRECT: CALCULATE([DIF CA/CA_N-1], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """, DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3)
                   - INCORRECT: Trying to calculate differences across multiple years in a single CALCULATE function

                4. FIXING COMMON YoY QUERY ERRORS:
                   If you encounter errors with complex YoY queries using measures like [CA/N-1] or [DIF CA/CA_N-1]:

                   a. First try the simplified single-row approach shown in point #2

                   b. If that fails, try splitting into two separate queries:
                      - Query 1: Get current year values only
                      - Query 2: Get previous year values only
                      - Then present both results to the user

                   c. For percentage calculations, always use DIVIDE() with a fallback value (0):
                      DIVIDE(current_value - previous_value, previous_value, 0)

                5. AVOIDING MEASURE SYNTAX ERRORS:
                   - Always use correct syntax for N-1 measures: [CA/N-1], NOT [CA]/N-1 or [[CA]/N-1]
                   - Always use correct syntax for difference measures: [DIF CA/CA_N-1], NOT [DIF [CA]/CA_N-1]
                   - Ensure you never have double brackets [[...]] in your measures

                EXAMPLE YoY QUERY PATTERN THAT WORKS CONSISTENTLY:

                ```
                EVALUATE
                ROW(
                    "Q3 """ + str(current_year) + """ Revenue for HCS", CALCULATE(
                        [CA],
                        PT[BU] = "HCS",
                        DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """,
                        DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3
                    ),
                    "Q3 """ + str(previous_year) + """ Revenue for HCS", CALCULATE(
                        [CA],
                        PT[BU] = "HCS",
                        DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(previous_year) + """,
                        DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3
                    ),
                    "Year-over-Year Difference", CALCULATE(
                        [CA],
                        PT[BU] = "HCS",
                        DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """,
                        DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3
                    ) - CALCULATE(
                        [CA],
                        PT[BU] = "HCS",
                        DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(previous_year) + """,
                        DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE] = 3
                    )
                )
                ```

                This approach is more reliable than trying to use multiple measures within SUMMARIZECOLUMNS for YoY comparisons.

                KEY TABLE-COLUMN MAPPINGS TO REMEMBER:

                1. CRITICAL ENTITY VALIDATION WITH HIERARCHICAL FALLBACK AND TYPO DETECTION:
                   Users often confuse Business Units (BU) with Sub-Business Units (Sous BU) or Poles, and may misspell entity names.

                   SMART QUERY STRATEGY WITH NO-RESULTS HANDLING:
                   - When a user mentions a specific entity name, FIRST try the most logical location (PT[BU] for business units)
                   - If the query returns NO RESULTS or EMPTY data, follow this hierarchical validation sequence:

                   STEP-BY-STEP NO-RESULTS RECOVERY PROCESS:

                   Step 1: PRIMARY LOCATION TEST
                   ```
                   -- For "HCS business unit", first try:
                   CALCULATE([CA], PT[BU] = "HCS", ...)
                   ```

                   Step 2: IF NO RESULTS → HIERARCHICAL FALLBACK
                   ```
                   -- If PT[BU] returns no results, try PT[Sous BU]:
                   CALCULATE([CA], PT[Sous BU] = "HCS", ...)

                   -- If still no results, try PT[Pôle]:
                   CALCULATE([CA], PT[Pôle] = "HCS", ...)
                   ```

                   Step 3: IF STILL NO RESULTS → TYPO DETECTION & CORRECTION
                   ```
                   -- Get all available entities to find closest match:

                   For BU entities:
                   EVALUATE DISTINCT(PT[BU])

                   For Sous BU entities:
                   EVALUATE DISTINCT(PT[Sous BU])

                   For Pole entities:
                   EVALUATE DISTINCT(PT[Pôle])

                   For Client entities:
                   EVALUATE DISTINCT(DIM_CLIENT[Client])
                   ```

                   Step 4: SIMILARITY MATCHING & CORRECTION
                   - Compare user input with available entities
                   - Look for close matches (e.g., "Plateforme" → "Plateformes", "HCS" → "HSC")
                   - Common typo patterns: singular/plural, missing/extra letters, case differences
                   - If close match found (>80% similarity), use corrected name and inform user

                   Step 5: RE-RUN ORIGINAL QUERY WITH CORRECTED ENTITY
                   ```
                   -- Original failed: PT[Pôle] = "Plateforme"
                   -- Corrected: PT[Pôle] = "Plateformes"
                   CALCULATE([CA], PT[Pôle] = "Plateformes", DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """)
                   ```

                   IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLE FOR "Plateforme" CASE:
                   ```
                   User asks: "Revenue for Plateforme pole"

                   1. Try: PT[Pôle] = "Plateforme" → No results
                   2. Get available poles: EVALUATE DISTINCT(PT[Pôle])
                   3. Find closest match: "Plateformes" (92% similarity)
                   4. Inform user: "I found 'Plateformes' instead of 'Plateforme'"
                   5. Re-run: PT[Pôle] = "Plateformes" → Success!
                   ```

                   ENTITY VALIDATION PRIORITY FOR BUSINESS UNITS:
                   1. PT[BU] = "EntityName" (main business units)
                   2. PT[Sous BU] = "EntityName" (sub business units)  
                   3. PT[Pôle] = "EntityName" (business poles)
                   4. Typo detection across all three
                   5. Show available options if no close match

                   ENTITY VALIDATION PRIORITY FOR CLIENTS:
                   1. DIM_CLIENT[Client] = "ClientName" (exact client name)
                   2. DIM_CLIENT[RAISON_SOCIALE_DO] LIKE "%ClientName%" (partial company name match)
                   3. Typo detection in client names
                   4. Show available client options

                   ALWAYS INFORM USER ABOUT CORRECTIONS:
                   ✅ "I found 'Plateformes' instead of 'Plateforme'. Here's the analysis for Plateformes pole..."
                   ✅ "The entity 'HCS' was found in Sub Business Units rather than main Business Units."
                   ✅ "No exact match for 'Platforme' found. Using closest match 'Plateforme'."
                   ❌ Don't silently use different entities without explanation

                2. Always filter Business Units using PT table:
                   - For main BU: PT[BU] = "HCS"
                   - For sub-BU: PT[Sous BU] = "Digital Solutions"
                   - For Pole: PT[Pôle] = "Pole Name"

                3. Always filter clients using DIM_CLIENT table and link through PT:
                   - For client name: DIM_CLIENT[Client] = "Client Name"
                   - For client number: DIM_CLIENT[NUM_TIERS] = "Client Number"
                   - Link with PT: Through PT[Num_Client] = DIM_CLIENT[NUM_TIERS]

                4. Always filter projects using PROJECT columns in PT:
                   - For project name: PT[PROJET_LIB] = "Project Name"
                   - For project code: PT[PROJET] = "P123"

                5. Always filter products using MAPPING_PRODUIT:
                   - Correct: MAPPING_PRODUIT[Produit] = "Product Name" or MAPPING_PRODUIT[Code Produit] = "P123"
                   - Link with PT: Through PT[SOCIETE_PRODUIT_KEY] = MAPPING_PRODUIT[SOCIETE_PRODUIT_KEY]

                6. For activities, use MAPPING_ACTIVITE:
                   - Activity name: MAPPING_ACTIVITE[Activité] = "Activity Name"
                   - Link with PT: Through PT[SOCIETE_ACTIVITE_KEY] = MAPPING_ACTIVITE[SOCIETE_ACTIVITE_KEY]

                7. Avoid using CALCULATE with FILTER within SUMMARIZECOLUMNS:
                   - Prefer: SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(table[column], "Measure", CALCULATE([Measure], conditions...))
                   - Instead of: SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(FILTER(table, conditions...), "Measure", [Measure])

                8. For date hierarchies, remember these columns exist:
                   - DIM_DATE[Année]: Year number
                   - DIM_DATE[TRIMESTRE]: Quarter number (1-4)
                   - DIM_DATE[MOIS]: Month number (1-12)
                   - DIM_DATE[MOIS_NOM]: Month name
                   - DIM_DATE[SEMESTRE]: Semester (1-2)

                9. Key PT table columns for filtering:
                   - PT[EXERCICE]: Fiscal year (number)
                   - PT[MOIS]: Month (number)
                   - PT[SOCIETE]: Company code
                   - PT[CDR]: Cost center code
                   - PT[ACTIVITE]: Activity code
                   - PT[PROJET]: Project code
                   - PT[PRODUIT]: Product code
                   - PT[Client]: Client identifier

                HOW TO HANDLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCIAL QUESTIONS:

                1. For simple metric requests (e.g., "what's the revenue for """ + str(current_year) + """?"):
                   Use the appropriate predefined measure directly, e.g.:
                   EVALUATE
                   ROW("Revenue """ + str(current_year) + """", CALCULATE([CA], DIM_DATE[Année] = """ + str(current_year) + """))

                2. For budget vs. actual analysis:
                   Use the appropriate predefined measures, e.g.:
                   EVALUATE
                   SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
                       DIM_DATE[MOIS],
                       DIM_DATE[MOIS_NOM],
                       "Revenue", [CA],
                       "Budget", [BUDGET_CA],
                       "Variance", [DIF CA/BUDGET]
                   )

                3. For year-over-year analysis:
                   Use the appropriate predefined measures, e.g.:
                   EVALUATE
                   SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
                       DIM_DATE[MOIS],
                       DIM_DATE[MOIS_NOM],
                       "Current Year", [CA],
                       "Previous Year", [CA/N-1],

                   )

                4. For product/client/project performance:
                   Use the appropriate predefined measures with the right dimensions, e.g.:
                   EVALUATE
                   TOPN(10,
                       SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(

                           "Revenue", [CA],
                           "Margin", [MB],
                           "Margin %", [MB(%)]
                       ),
                       [Revenue], DESC

                ENHANCED WORKFLOW FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS WITH NO-RESULTS RECOVERY:

                1. DETERMINE QUESTION TYPE:
                   - For simple requests like "list tables" or "show schema", use the appropriate tool directly.
                   - For requests about financial metrics (revenue, margin, budget), identify which predefined measures to use.
                   - For complex analytical queries, first check if there's a matching example.

                2. FOR FINANCIAL METRIC QUESTIONS:
                   a. Identify which measures are needed for the question (e.g., [CA] for revenue, [MB] for gross margin)
                   b. Use info_powerbi_tool with search_term=<term> to find relevant measures if needed
                   c. Construct DAX queries using these predefined measures, NOT from table columns

                3. FOR COMPLEX ANALYTICAL QUERIES:
                   a. Use match_query_example_tool to check if there's a similar predefined query
                   b. If an EXACT_MATCH is found, use query_powerbi_tool directly with the provided query
                   c. If a SIMILAR_MATCH is found, adapt the template query by changing the parameters mentioned in the match result
                   d. If NO_MATCH is found, proceed with data exploration and query construction

                4. DATA EXPLORATION (for novel queries or adaptation):
                   a. Use info_powerbi_tool with table_name='MEASURES' to see all available predefined measures
                   b. Use schema_powerbi_tool to examine specific tables
                   c. Construct an appropriate DAX query based on the user's question, using predefined measures when available
                   d. Use query_powerbi_tool to execute the DAX query

                5. **NEW: NO-RESULTS RECOVERY PROTOCOL** (Apply when queries return empty/no results):

                   a. **HIERARCHICAL ENTITY FALLBACK**: If a query with specific entity returns no results:
                      - For BU entities: Try PT[BU] → PT[Sous BU] → PT[Pôle]
                      - For Client entities: Try DIM_CLIENT[Client] → DIM_CLIENT[RAISON_SOCIALE_DO] (partial match)

                   b. **TYPO DETECTION & CORRECTION**: If hierarchical fallback fails:
                      - Get all available entities: EVALUATE DISTINCT(PT[BU]), DISTINCT(PT[Sous BU]), DISTINCT(PT[Pôle]), DISTINCT(DIM_CLIENT[Client])
                      - Compare user input with available entities to find closest matches
                      - Look for common typo patterns: "Plateforme" vs "Plateformes", case differences, missing letters
                      - If close match found (>80% similarity), use corrected entity and inform user

                   c. **RE-RUN WITH CORRECTED ENTITY**: 
                      - Execute original query with corrected entity name
                      - Inform user about the correction made
                      - If still no results after correction, then genuinely no data exists

                   d. **USER COMMUNICATION**: Always explain what was tried and corrected:
                      ✅ "I found 'Plateformes' instead of 'Plateforme'. Using corrected name..."
                      ✅ "Entity found in Sub Business Units rather than main Business Units."
                      ✅ "No data found for any variation of this entity name."

                6. LANGUAGE ADAPTATION PROTOCOL:
                   - **DETECT USER LANGUAGE**: Identify the language of the user's question

                IMPORTANT DAX QUERY RULES:
                1. All DAX queries must start with EVALUATE
                2. Everything after EVALUATE must return a table expression
                3. To return a single value, use ROW() function:
                   EVALUATE ROW("Label", CALCULATE([Measure], Filters))
                4. For tabular data, use functions like SUMMARIZECOLUMNS, TOPN, etc.
                5. ALWAYS use predefined measures ([CA], [MB], etc.) instead of manually aggregating columns (e.g., use [CA] instead of SUM(PT[MONTANT]))

                IMPORTANT DAX SYNTAX RULES:
                1. Never include the language identifier (e.g., "DAX") in the query itself
                2. Always use EVALUATE at the beginning of the query only once
                3. For VAR-based queries, follow this exact pattern:
                   EVALUATE
                   VAR MyVariable = ...
                   RETURN
                       MyVariable

                4. Prefer SUMMARIZECOLUMNS over SUMMARIZE for better performance and handling of nulls
                5. Ensure all parentheses are properly balanced
                6. When using action inputs with query_powerbi_tool, format like this:
                   Action Input: EVALUATE ... (without extra backticks or language identifiers)
                7. Never prefix measures with table names - use [CA] not PT[CA]

                The most common DAX syntax errors to avoid:
                - Including the language identifier in the query
                - Having multiple EVALUATE statements
                - Forgetting to include a RETURN statement when using VAR
                - Unbalanced parentheses in complex expressions
                - Using PT[MONTANT] with SUM() instead of the appropriate measure like [CA]

                """ + IMPROVED_PATTERNS + """

                CRITICAL SUCCESS PATTERNS FOR NO-RESULTS SCENARIOS:

                EXAMPLE 1 - "Plateforme" typo scenario:
                User asks: "Quel est l'évolution du CA pour le pôle Plateforme ?"

                Step 1: Try PT[Pôle] = "Plateforme" → No results
                Step 2: Get available poles: EVALUATE DISTINCT(PT[Pôle])
                Step 3: Find closest match: "Plateformes" (high similarity)
                Step 4: Re-run with PT[Pôle] = "Plateformes" → Success!
                Step 5: Respond in French: "J'ai trouvé 'Plateformes' au lieu de 'Plateforme'. Voici l'évolution..."

                EXAMPLE 2 - BU vs Sous BU confusion:
                User asks: "HCS revenue performance"

                Step 1: Try PT[BU] = "HCS" → No results
                Step 2: Try PT[Sous BU] = "HCS" → Success!
                Step 3: Respond: "Found 'HCS' in Sub Business Units rather than main Business Units. Here's the analysis..."

                EXAMPLE 3 - Client name variations:
                User asks: "Revenue for Docapost client"

                Step 1: Try DIM_CLIENT[Client] = "Docapost" → No results
                Step 2: Try partial match: DIM_CLIENT[RAISON_SOCIALE_DO] LIKE "%Docapost%" → Success!
                Step 3: Respond: "Found client with company name containing 'Docapost'. Here's the revenue analysis..."

                Always remember to use predefined measures like [CA], [MB], [BUDGET_CA] instead of
                trying to recreate these calculations using raw table columns.

                FINAL REMINDER: Respond in the same language as the user's question - French questions get French responses, English questions get English responses, etc.
